# Domain component workspace

`domain/component/page/domain-playground` is the root shell used by the app route. It owns the screen state and keeps the domain menu, viewport controls and settings panel above the current workspace surface.

`domain/component/page/domain-landing` is the landing surface for this domain. It explains why the workspace exists and routes people into the component playground instead of treating the library as a flat component dump.

## Screen Structure

├─ organism/domain-diagnostics            - story runner + manifest-driven file diagnostics
│  └─ organism/domain-file-diagnostics    - manifest dashboard, always rendered above the story runner
│     ├─ organism/domain-file-overview           - file/component totals from the domain-files manifest
│     ├─ organism/domain-cluster-balance         - per-domain cluster balance from the domain-files manifest
│     ├─ organism/domain-component-import-diagnostics - import-health rows/summary from the import-diagnostics manifest
│     └─ organism/domain-file-domain-grid        - per-domain file grid from the domain-files manifest
└─ organism/domain-settings               - theme settings panel
```

`domain-diagnostics` combines two independent checks: the story runner (imports and mounts every `*.story.svelte` to catch runtime errors) and `domain-file-diagnostics`, a static dashboard fed by generated manifests rather than by running code:
- `data/json/domain-files/index.json` — file/component counts and cluster balance per domain
- `data/json/domain-component-intervals/index.json` — component size/interval stats, consumed by `domain-file-overview`
- `data/json/domain-component-import-diagnostics/index.json` — import-health rows and summary, consumed by `domain-component-import-diagnostics`

These manifests are generated data (see the sibling stylist tooling); global regeneration is human-only. The page manifest contains only tree, with dictionaries at every level: domain/cluster/joint/family maps directly to a PRESET_FILE string key. ARRAY_FILE is the filename catalog, parsed together with PRESET_FILE by a single Python parser. Explorer reconstructs all paths/files through normalizeDomainTree, resolveTreeFamilies, resolveFilePreset and expandComponentTree. resolveComponentDescriptor derives API projection on demand, checking actual entries in the tree; no descriptors section is serialized. countDomainStories computes the landing statistic from presets. See [file catalog and compact manifest](../../../../../docs/component-manifest-presets.md) for the encoding contract and measurements.

The workspace node-editor demo, the drag-and-drop template builder (`domain-builder`), the backlog/sprint surface (`domain-backlog`) and the AI assistant panel (`domain-ai-agent`, with its `audio/component/organism/transcriber` dependency) were extracted out of this library into `stylist-svelte-domains` (sibling package, same `<domain>/<cluster>/<joint>/<family>` shape) — kept for reuse elsewhere, not wired into this app.

## Purpose

The page manifest encodes canonical `index.svg` entries as `"INDEX_SVG"` from `const/preset/file`. Every family stores one preset string covering its complete file composition. Explorer restores filenames and paths when consuming the tree.

The domain workspace makes the component library readable before it becomes gigantic. It compresses the architecture into a navigable shape: domains describe subject areas, clusters describe language-level entity types, joints describe logical roles, and families keep related implementation files together.

The landing page should introduce that model and point users toward the interactive component browser. It is not a marketing wrapper around demos; it is the front door to the system's structure.

## Landing Copy

- **Hero**: presents Stylist Svelte as a domain-shaped workspace for reading, reviewing and growing the component system.
- **CTA buttons**: both Browse Components and Interactive Playground open the component playground.
- **Why Stylist?**: explains the practical value of the workspace.
- **Atomic Design architecture**: states how atom, molecule, organism and template composition remains visible inside domain context.
- **Readable navigation**: explains why the library is navigated by domain, cluster, joint and family.
- **Story-first review**: connects stories with implementation files, markdown and JSON context.
- **Domain diagnostics**: keeps diagnostics and manifests part of the maintenance loop.
- **Our Mission**: make the component library readable before it becomes gigantic.

## Notes

- Selecting a domain, cluster, joint or family opens the component playground when a story preview exists.
- Component stories live next to their component source as `index.story.svelte`.
- Generated barrel `index.ts` files are maintained by the indexation workflow.
